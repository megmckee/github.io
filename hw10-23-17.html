<h4>Project idea: Charting opiate overdose deaths nationally over time</h4>
<p>This <a href="https://www.opendatanetwork.com/dataset/data.cdc.gov/jxry-4c39">CDC data set</a> is available as an API via the Open Data Network, a humungous data repository.
  I chose this set because it's national in scope -- there are many state-level databases available, too -- and a topic I care about.
</p>
<img src="CDC opiate stats screenshot.png" class="imgcenter" width="75%"></img>
<p>There are about 6,500 records, and the variables in the dataset include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>State</li>
  <li>Year</li>
  <li>Month</li>
  <li>Indicator, which is the exact type of opiate involved in death</li>
  <li>The data's percentage of completeness</li>
  <li>Percent of deaths pending investigation</li>
  </ul>

<p>
The data also has a footnote column to document any issues with the data.

</p>
<p>The obvious choice for visualization would be a map-based viz. There are also opportunities to look at deaths by time of the year, and clusters where a spat of deaths happened over a short period of time. <br>Before committing to a design (or designs) I am attending a one-day workshop this Wednesday, Oct. 25, with the amazing viz-master Edward Tufte. One of the amazing parts is all attendees are given all four of his books. I purposely signed up for this conference knowing it would be invaluable to this class and my project.

<h4>CDC data on opiate overdose deaths nationally</h4>
<p>This <a href="https://www.opendatanetwork.com/dataset/data.cdc.gov/jxry-4c39">data set</a> is available as an API via the Open Data Network, a humungous data repository.
  I chose this set because it's national in scope -- there are many state-level databases available, too -- and a topic I care about.
</p>

<p>The variables in the dataset include:
  -State
  -Year
  -Month
  -Indicator, which is the exact type of opiate involved in death
  -The data's percentage of completeness
  -Percent of deaths pending investigation</p>

<p>
The data also has a footnote column to document any issues with the data.

</p>
<p>The obvious choice for visualization would be a map-based viz. Before committing to a design (or designs) I am attending a one-day workshop this Wednesday, Oct. 25, with Edward Tufte. One of the amazing parts is all attendees are given all four of his books. I purposely signed up for this conference knowing it would be invaluable to this class and my project.
